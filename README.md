# ChidoriMenu 🐦⚡️

A seamless drop-in replacement for UIMenu & UIAction, featuring nested menu support and dark mode compatibility.

The inspiration behind this project stems from Apple's lack of a unified interface across iOS and Mac Catalyst apps, as well as the absence of a built-in menu presentation method. To address these gaps—and to enable greater customization—we developed ChidoriMenu.

This project draws heavily on code from [ChidoriMenu](https://github.com/christianselig/ChidoriMenu), and as such, we adhere to the same license.

## Usage

Getting started is straightforward. While the interface differs slightly from Apple's menu implementation, the core principles remain the same. Mac Catalyst is fully supported, though it does not bridge to AppKit menus—it functions identically to iOS.

```swift
UIButton.presentMenu()
UIView.present(menu: menu)
```

For detailed examples, check out the example project included in the repository.
