# ChidoriMenu üê¶‚ö°Ô∏è

An easy way to add popover menus visually similar to the [Context Menus](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/controls/context-menus/) and [Pull Down Menus](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/controls/pull-down-menus/) iOS uses but with some advantages. (Effectively just a rebuild of Pull Down Menus as a custom view controller to gain some flexibility.)

Copied most of the code from [https://github.com/christianselig/ChidoriMenu](https://github.com/christianselig/ChidoriMenu), same license.

## Features
